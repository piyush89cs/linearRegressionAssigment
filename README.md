## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

- day.csv is being used which is historical data of current loans and past loans.

- Rental usage depends on many factors like Temperature, waether Situation and year
- Some may have positive impact as temperature  and some can have negative as Heavy Rains on Rental Usage
